## Proposal Sent

To whom it may concern,

I am submitting my proposal for the Batch Scripting task. I have already completed the task, including writing the script and test cases, to fulfill my understanding of the specified requirements.

To demonstrate the completed work, I have prepared a YouTube video showcasing the functionality of the script. You can view the video at the YouTube following link: https://youtu.be/a-KyHTkYOvw

The script, "move_and_archive.bat," and the accompanying test cases provide a reliable solution that meets the outlined requirements. The test cases cover different scenarios, including happy paths and potential error cases, ensuring the script's robustness and reliability.

I understand that your specific requirements may differ or you may have additional modifications in mind. I am more than willing to accommodate any changes you require to tailor the solution to your exact needs.

Thank you for considering my proposal. Please review the YouTube video to get a comprehensive understanding of the completed task. I am available to discuss any further details or modifications you may have in mind.

Best,

Asa LeHolland
